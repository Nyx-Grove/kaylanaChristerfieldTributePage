            <h2> Introduction</h2>
                <p> 
                    Today we will learn about an amazing woman called Nellie Bly. 
                    I admire Nellie Bly because she was an independent, fearless, and kind woman. 
                    Even though Nellie had done poorly in school she was an amazing writer; she was such a good writer that she got a job for her writing. 
                    Her writing gave her a platform to expose places that had poor treatment to the people there. 
                    After she did something significant she wrote a book about it. This has allowed us to know the full story long after her death. 
                    If someone said this woman couldn’t do something she would walk right past them and go do it anyway. 
                    It’s so sad that barely anyone knows about which is why I will tell you about her now.
                </p>
                
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Before she was known as Nellie Bly she was Elizabeth Cochran; She was also known as pink because she wore bright colors like pink for attention. 
                    At this time women wore more dull colors like brown and tan. Nellie lived in  Cochran's Mills, Pennsylvania, a town founded by her father. 
                    She lived with her parents and her multiple siblings; Her father had provided for the family until 1870 when he had died. 
                    He had died with no will leaving her family fincally unstable. Her mother had remarried a man who was an alcoholic and abusive; Soon her mother had enough and filed for divource.
                    At 14 yrs old  she had to testify for the divource trail.
                </p>

            <h2> Start of Career</h2>
                <p>
                    Nellie went to school to purse teaching which was one of the few careers a women could have then. 
                    She was only able to attend one semester before she was no longer able to pay the tuition. Bly ended up moving in with her mother in pittsburgh and helping her run a boarding house. 
                    One day she picks up a paper titled “What Girls are Good for”; According to the paper women are only good for at home task and went so far as to call working women an monstrosity. 
                    This made Bly so upset she had sent a letter in responds debunking the article. The producers of the article were so impressed they had given her a job there and with the job the pen name Nellie Bly. 
                    Bly wrote articles about things like women suffrage which were controvisal and that worried the publishers. Because of this they started to send Bly to write about fashion and flowers wish they felt were more suited for a women. 
                    Her finally attempt t be taken seriously was her six month trip trough mexico; Even after that she was still downgraded so she quit.
